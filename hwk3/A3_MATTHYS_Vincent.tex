% Syntax for using figure macros:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \singlefig{filename}{scalefactor}{caption}{label}
% \doublefig{\subfig{filename}{scalefactor}{subcaption}{sublabel}}
%           {\subfig{filename}{scalefactor}{subcaption}{sublabel}}
%           {global caption}{label}
% \triplefig{\subfig{filename}{scalefactor}{subcaption}{sublabel}}
%           {\subfig{filename}{scalefactor}{subcaption}{sublabel}}
%           {\subfig{filename}{scalefactor}{subcaption}{sublabel}}
%           {global caption}{label}
%
% Tips:
% - with scalefactor=1, a single figure will take the whole page width; a double figure, half page width; and a triple figure, a third of the page width
% - image files should be placed in the image folder
% - no need to put image extension to include the image
% - for vector graphics (plots), pdf figures are suggested
% - for images, jpg/png are suggested
% - labels can be left empty {}
